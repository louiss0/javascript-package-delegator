= TODO: Ginkgo CLI Learning Project

== Bugs

[CAUTION]
.CoverpkgInconsistencies
====

File: coverage*.out
Issue: Coverage results show slight variations between different package filtering approaches
Description:
• Structural approach (excluding build_info from --coverpkg) shows 81.5%
• Post-processing approach (grep -v) also shows 81.5% 
• Raw --coverpkg=./... shows 80.5%
• Need to verify which approach gives most accurate results
====

[CAUTION]
.CompletionTestMismatch
====

File: cmd/completion_ginkgo_test.go
Function: Test cases expecting carapace and --with-shorthand support
Description:
• Tests expect carapace shell support but CLI only supports bash, fish, nushell, powershell, zsh
• Tests expect --with-shorthand flag but completion command doesn't recognize it
• Need to align test expectations with actual CLI implementation
====

== Refactors

[WARNING]
.BuildInfoStructuralSeparation
====

File: build_info/pkg.go
Code: Entire build_info package structure
Description:
• Current build_info package should be moved to internal/buildinfo for better organization
• Update all import statements throughout codebase
• Modify Makefile PKGS filtering to exclude internal/buildinfo instead of build_info
• Align with Go project layout standards
====

[WARNING]
.GinkgoTestLabels
====

File: cmd/completion_ginkgo_test.go
File: shell_alias/suite_test.go  
File: internal/completion/suite_test.go
Code: Describe blocks lacking labels
Description:
• Add semantic labels to test suites for better filtering
• Slow integration tests should have Label("slow", "integration")
• Fast unit tests should have Label("fast", "unit")
• CLI-specific tests should have Label("cli")
====

[WARNING]
.CmdSuitePackageConsistency
====

File: cmd/cmd_suite_test.go
Code: package cmd_test declaration
Description:
• New cmd_suite_test.go uses package cmd_test but completion_ginkgo_test.go uses package cmd
• Standardize on either internal testing (package cmd) or external testing (package cmd_test)
• Update imports and test structure accordingly
====

== Features

[IMPORTANT]
.MakefileCIIntegration
====

File: Makefile.ginkgo
Code: CI targets and GitHub Actions workflow
Description:
• Wire Makefile targets into CI pipeline (.github/workflows/test.yml)
• Add junit report generation and artifact upload
• Implement pre-commit hooks for ginkgo unfocus validation
• Add coverage threshold enforcement (fail below 80%)
====

[IMPORTANT]
.TestSuiteBootstrapMissing
====

File: Various packages missing suite files
Code: Missing *_suite_test.go files
Description:
• Run `find . -name "*.go" -path "*/test*" | grep -v suite` to identify packages needing bootstrap
• Execute ginkgo bootstrap in packages with Ginkgo tests but no suite files
• Ensure consistent BDD test structure across all packages
====

[IMPORTANT]
.AdvancedGinkgoFeatures
====

File: Test files throughout project
Code: Basic Describe/Context/It structure
Description:
• Implement BeforeAll/AfterAll for expensive setup/teardown
• Add shared behaviors using Shared Examples pattern
• Implement custom matchers for domain-specific assertions
• Add test timeouts for long-running specs using Specify with timeouts
====

[IMPORTANT]
.GinkgoBenchmarkIntegration
====

File: Performance-critical code paths
Code: Functions needing benchmark tests
Description:
• Add Measure blocks for performance regression detection
• Integrate with existing benchmark tests or create new ones
• Set up CI performance monitoring and alerting
• Document performance expectations and thresholds
====

[IMPORTANT]
.WatchModeConfiguration
====

File: .ginkgo.yml or similar config
Code: Missing watch mode configuration
Description:
• Configure ginkgo watch with appropriate file patterns
• Set up ignore patterns for generated files, vendor directories
• Define watch-specific test running strategies (fail-fast, selective execution)
• Document watch mode usage for development workflow
