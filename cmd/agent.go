// in the current project, equivalent to the `na` command in `@antfu/ni`.
// It is useful for quickly identifying which package manager `jpd` would delegate to.
//
// The command's `RunE` function retrieves the detected package manager name from the
// command's persistent flags (which is populated by the root command's PersistentPreRunE
// logic) and then executes a command to show information about that package manager.
