Equivalent to 'na' command - detects and displays the package manager being used.

This command shows which package manager would be used based on lock files in the current directory.

Examples:
  javascript-package-delegator agent    # Show detected package manager`,
		Aliases: []string{"a"},
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			if err := runAgent(args); err != nil {

				os.Exit(1)
			}
