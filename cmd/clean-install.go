		Short: "Clean install packages using the detected package manager",
		Long: `Clean install packages using the appropriate package manager with frozen lockfile.
Equivalent to 'nci' command - detects npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun and runs clean install.

This command is designed for CI environments and production builds where you want to install
exactly what's in the lockfile without updating it.

Examples:
  javascript-package-delegator clean-install     # Clean install all dependencies`,
		Aliases: []string{"ci"},
		RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {

			pm := getPackageNameFromCommandContext(cmd)
			appEnv := getAppEnvFromCommandContext(cmd)
			// Build command based on package manager
			var cmdArgs []string
			switch pm {
			case "npm":
				cmdArgs = []string{"ci"}

			case "yarn":
				// Yarn v1 uses install --frozen-lockfile, v2+ uses install --immutable
				yarnVersion, err := getYarnVersion()
				if err != nil || strings.HasPrefix(yarnVersion, "1.") {
					// Yarn v1 or unknown version
					cmdArgs = []string{"install", "--frozen-lockfile"}
				} else {
					// Yarn v2+
					cmdArgs = []string{"install", "--immutable"}
				}

			case "pnpm":
				cmdArgs = []string{"install", "--frozen-lockfile"}

			case "bun":
				cmdArgs = []string{"install", "--frozen-lockfile"}

				return fmt.Errorf("%s doesn't support this command", "deno")

			default:
				return fmt.Errorf("unsupported package manager: %s", pm)
			}

			execCmd := exec.Command(pm, cmdArgs...)
