		Long: `JavaScript Package Delegator (jpd) - A universal package manager interface that detects
and delegates to the appropriate package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, or deno) based on
lock files and config files in your project.

Inspired by @antfu/ni, this tool provides a unified CLI experience across different
JavaScript runtimes and package managers, making it easy to work in teams with different
preferences or switch between Node.js and Deno projects.

Available commands:
  install    - Install packages (equivalent to 'ni')
  run        - Run package.json scripts (equivalent to 'nr')
  exec       - Execute packages (equivalent to 'nlx')
  update     - Update packages (equivalent to 'nup')
  uninstall  - Uninstall packages (equivalent to 'nun')
  clean-install - Clean install with frozen lockfile (equivalent to 'nci')
  agent      - Show detected package manager (equivalent to 'na')`,
