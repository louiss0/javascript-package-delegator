		Short: "JavaScript Package Delegator - A universal package manager interface",
		Long: `JavaScript Package Delegator (jpd) - A universal package manager interface that detects
and delegates to the appropriate package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, or deno) based on
lock files and config files in your project.

Inspired by @antfu/ni, this tool provides a unified CLI experience across different
JavaScript runtimes and package managers, making it easy to work in teams with different
preferences or switch between Node.js and Deno projects.

Available commands:
  install    - Install packages (equivalent to 'ni')
  run        - Run package.json scripts (equivalent to 'nr')
  exec       - Execute packages (equivalent to 'nlx')
  update     - Update packages (equivalent to 'nup')
  uninstall  - Uninstall packages (equivalent to 'nun')
  clean-install - Clean install with frozen lockfile (equivalent to 'nci')
  agent      - Show detected package manager (equivalent to 'na')`,
		// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
		// has an action associated with it:
		// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
	}

	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.mini-clis.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
