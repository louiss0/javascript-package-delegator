## What is jpd?

**javascript-package-delegator (jpd)** is a powerful CLI tool that eliminates the friction of working across JavaScript projects with different package managers. Instead of remembering whether a project uses `npm install`, `yarn add`, `pnpm add`, or `bun add`, you simply use `jpd install` and let the tool figure out the rest.

Inspired by [@antfu/ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni), jpd automatically detects your project's package manager by analyzing lock files and configuration, then transparently delegates commands to the appropriate tool. This creates a **unified development experience** that's especially valuable for:

- **Teams with diverse preferences** (some prefer npm, others prefer pnpm)
- **Polyglot developers** switching between Node.js and Deno projects  
- **Monorepos** with different package managers in different workspaces
- **Open source contributors** working across many different projects

## Key Features

## Supported Package Managers

jpd seamlessly works with all major JavaScript package managers:

- **npm** - The default Node.js package manager
- **Yarn** - Both v1 (Classic) and v2+ (Berry) with intelligent version detection
- **pnpm** - Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **Bun** - All-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit
- **Deno** - Secure runtime with built-in TypeScript support

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under a minute:

```bash
# Install jpd
brew install louiss0/tap/jpd

# Detect your project's package manager
jpd agent

# Install dependencies (equivalent to npm/yarn/pnpm/bun install)
jpd install

# Run a script interactively
jpd run
```

## Mental Model

jpd follows a clean **Why/What/How** CLI design:

- **Why** (Root): `jpd` represents the universal package manager interface
- **What** (Subcommands): `install`, `run`, `exec`, `update`, etc. represent the actions you want to take
- **How** (Flags): `--agent`, `--cwd`, `--debug` modify how those actions are executed

This design makes jpd predictable and easy to learn, whether you're a newcomer or switching from existing tools.
