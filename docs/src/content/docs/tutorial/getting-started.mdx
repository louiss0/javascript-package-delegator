Welcome to jpd! This tutorial will get you up and running in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to install jpd, detect your package manager, and use the most common commands.

## Installation

jpd is distributed as a single binary and can be installed via popular package managers:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS/Linux (Homebrew)">
    ```bash
    brew install louiss0/tap/jpd
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Windows (Scoop)">
    ```bash
    scoop bucket add louiss0 https://github.com/louiss0/scoop-bucket.git
    scoop install jpd
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Windows (Winget)">
    ```bash
    winget install jpd
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Manual Installation">
    1. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/louiss0/javascript-package-delegator/releases)
    2. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system:
       - `jpd-linux-amd64` for Linux x64
       - `jpd-darwin-amd64` for macOS Intel
       - `jpd-darwin-arm64` for macOS Apple Silicon
       - `jpd-windows-amd64.exe` for Windows x64
    3. Rename the binary to `jpd` (or `jpd.exe` on Windows)
    4. Make it executable: `chmod +x jpd` (Linux/macOS)
    5. Move it to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`, `~/bin`)
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Nix">
    ```bash
    # Build via default.nix and install locally
    nix-build default.nix -A jpd
    # Symlink into your PATH (example)
    install -Dm755 ./result/bin/jpd ~/.local/bin/jpd

    # Or use a temporary shell with jpd available
    nix-shell -p "(import ./default.nix {}).jpd"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="tip">
  Once installed, run `jpd --version` to verify the installation was successful.

## Basic Workflow

<Steps>

1. **Detect your package manager**

   Navigate to any JavaScript project and run:
   
   ```bash
   jpd agent
   ```
   
   This shows which package manager jpd detected for your project. It will show something like `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, or `deno`.

2. **Install dependencies**

   Instead of remembering whether to run `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install`, just run:
   
   ```bash
   jpd install
   ```
   
   jpd automatically delegates to the correct package manager based on your project's lock files.

3. **Run scripts interactively**

   To see all available scripts and select one:
   
   ```bash
   jpd run
   ```
   
   Or run a specific script directly:
   
   ```bash
   jpd run dev
   jpd run build
   jpd run test
   ```

4. **Execute packages**

   Instead of `npx`, `yarn dlx`, `pnpm dlx`, or `bunx`:
   
   ```bash
   jpd exec create-react-app my-app
   jpd exec typescript --version
   jpd exec prettier --check .
   ```

</Steps>

## Common Tasks

### Adding Dependencies

Add packages to your project:

```bash
# Add a regular dependency
jpd install lodash

# Add a development dependency  
jpd install -D vitest

# Add multiple packages
jpd install react react-dom
```

<Aside type="note">
  jpd automatically uses the correct flags for each package manager:
  - npm: `--save-dev`
  - yarn: `--dev` 
  - pnpm: `--save-dev`
  - bun: `--development`
</Aside>

### Interactive Package Search

Search the npm registry and select packages interactively:

```bash
jpd install -s react
```

This opens an interactive interface where you can search for packages and select which ones to install.

### Updating Dependencies

Update all dependencies to their latest compatible versions:

```bash
jpd update
```

### Removing Dependencies

Remove packages from your project:

```bash
# Remove specific packages
jpd uninstall lodash

# Interactive removal - select packages to remove
jpd uninstall -i
```

### Clean Install for CI/CD

Perform a clean installation with frozen lockfiles (ideal for CI environments):

```bash
jpd clean-install
```

This maps to the appropriate command for each package manager:
- npm: `npm ci`
- yarn v1: `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
- yarn v2+: `yarn install --immutable`
- pnpm: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- bun: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`

## Advanced Usage

### Override the Agent

Sometimes you might want to force a specific package manager:

```bash
# Use yarn even if npm is detected
jpd install --agent yarn

# Set for entire session
export JPD_AGENT=yarn
jpd install
```

### Run Commands in Subprojects

Execute commands in different directories without changing your shell's working directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies in a subdirectory
jpd install --cwd ./my-frontend-app/

# Run build script in a subdirectory
jpd run --cwd ./packages/ui/ build
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Trailing Slash Requirement">
  The `--cwd` flag requires paths to end with `/` (except for root `/`). In CI builds compiled with the CI flag, both `path` and `path/` are accepted.
</Aside>

### Debug Mode

See exactly what commands jpd is executing:

```bash
jpd install --debug
jpd run build --debug
```

This shows detailed logging about package manager detection and the actual commands being run.

### Shell Completion

Enable tab completion for your shell:

```bash
# Bash
jpd completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/jpd

# Zsh (add to .zshrc)
jpd completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_jpd

# Fish
jpd completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/jpd.fish

# Nushell (with output flag)
jpd completion nushell --output ~/.config/nushell/completions/jpd_completions.nu
```

  **Having trouble?** Use the `jpd agent` command to see which package manager jpd detected, or try the `--debug` flag to see detailed detection information.
