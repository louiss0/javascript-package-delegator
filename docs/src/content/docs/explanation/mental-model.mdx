title: Mental model (Why / What / How)
description: Understand how jpd's root, subcommands, and flags map to Why, What, and How.

Understanding jpd's design philosophy helps you use the tool more effectively and predictably. jpd follows a clean **Why/What/How** mental model that makes the CLI intuitive and consistent.

## The Why/What/How Framework

jpd's command structure follows this logical hierarchy:

### **Why** → Root Command: `jpd`

The root command `jpd` represents the **Why** - your overall purpose or goal. In this case:

> "I want a universal package manager interface that works across all JavaScript runtimes."

When you type `jpd`, you're saying "I want to work with JavaScript packages, but I don't want to think about which specific package manager to use."

### **What** → Subcommands

Subcommands represent the **What** - the specific action or concept you want to work with:

| Subcommand | What it represents | Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| `install` | Package installation | Add dependencies to your project |
| `run` | Script execution | Execute tasks defined in your project |
| `exec` | Package execution | Run packages without installing them |
| `update` | Package updates | Upgrade dependencies to newer versions |
| `uninstall` | Package removal | Remove dependencies from your project |
| `clean-install` | Clean installation | Install packages with frozen lockfiles (CI/CD) |
| `agent` | Package manager detection | Show which package manager jpd detected |
| `completion` | Shell completion | Generate tab completion scripts |

Each subcommand is a **verb** (action) or **noun** (entity) that clearly describes what you're trying to accomplish.

### **How** → Flags and Environment Variables

Flags and environment variables represent the **How** - they modify how your action is executed:

#### Global Flags (How to execute any command)

| Flag | Purpose | Mental Model |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `--agent` / `-a` | Override package manager | "Do this, but force a specific tool" |
| `--cwd` / `-C` | Change working directory | "Do this, but in a different location" |
| `--debug` / `-d` | Enable debug logging | "Do this, but show me exactly what's happening" |

#### Command-Specific Flags (How to modify specific actions)

| Command | Flag | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `install` | `--dev` / `-D` | "Install this, but as a development dependency" |
| `install` | `--global` / `-g` | "Install this, but globally" |
| `install` | `--search` / `-s` | "Install this, but let me search for packages first" |
| `uninstall` | `--interactive` / `-i` | "Uninstall this, but let me select what to remove" |
| `run` | `--if-present` | "Run this, but only if the script exists" |

#### Environment Variables (Session-wide How)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `JPD_AGENT` | Set default package manager for the entire session |

## Real-World Examples

Let's see how this mental model works in practice:

### Example 1: Basic Installation

```bash
jpd install lodash
```

- **Why**: "I want to use the universal package manager interface"
- **What**: "To install a package"
- **How**: "Using whatever package manager jpd detects"

### Example 2: Development Dependency with Override

```bash
jpd install --dev --agent yarn vitest
```

- **Why**: "I want to use the universal package manager interface"
- **What**: "To install a package"
- **How**: "As a development dependency, using Yarn specifically"

### Example 3: Running in a Subproject with Debug

```bash
jpd run --cwd ./packages/ui/ --debug build
```

- **Why**: "I want to use the universal package manager interface"
- **What**: "To run a script"
- **How**: "In a specific directory, showing me debug information"

## Alignment with CLI Design Principles

jpd's mental model aligns with well-established CLI design principles:

### Predictability

Once you understand the Why/What/How pattern, you can predict how new commands will work:

- New **What** commands will be verbs or nouns describing actions/entities
- New **How** flags will modify behavior without changing the core action
- The **Why** (universal package management) remains constant

### Composability

Flags can be combined logically because they operate at the "How" level:

```bash
# Multiple "How" modifiers work together
jpd install --dev --global --agent pnpm --debug typescript
```

### Discoverability

The structure helps you discover functionality:

- `jpd --help` shows all the "What" you can do
- `jpd install --help` shows all the "How" for installation
- Tab completion guides you through valid combinations

## Consistent Help System

jpd's help system reinforces the mental model:

### Root Help (Why)

```bash
jpd --help
```

Shows the overall purpose and lists all available "What" actions.

### Command Help (What + How)

```bash
jpd install --help
```

Shows what installation does and all the ways you can modify how it works.

### Global Flags (How for Everything)

Global flags like `--agent`, `--cwd`, and `--debug` work consistently across all commands because they modify "How" rather than "What".

## Mental Model Benefits

Understanding this structure provides several benefits:

### 1. **Faster Learning**

New users can quickly understand the command structure without memorizing each command individually.

### 2. **Reduced Errors**

The logical hierarchy makes it easier to construct valid commands and avoid syntax errors.

### 3. **Better Automation**

Scripts and CI/CD pipelines become more maintainable when the underlying logic is clear.

### 4. **Easier Troubleshooting**

When something goes wrong, you can systematically check:
- Is the "Why" correct? (Are you using jpd appropriately?)
- Is the "What" correct? (Is this the right action?)
- Is the "How" correct? (Are the flags and environment set properly?)

## Comparison with Other Tools

Most package managers mix "What" and "How":

```bash
# Traditional approach - mixes what and how
npm install --save-dev typescript
yarn add --dev typescript
pnpm add --save-dev typescript

# jpd approach - clear separation
jpd install --dev typescript
```

jpd's approach keeps the "What" (install) consistent while only changing the "How" (--dev flag and auto-detected package manager).

## Advanced Usage Patterns

Once you understand the mental model, advanced patterns become intuitive:

### Session Configuration

```bash
export JPD_AGENT=yarn
# All subsequent jpd commands use Yarn
jpd install
jpd run build
jpd update
```

### Project-Specific Workflows

```bash
# Monorepo workflow - consistent "What", different "How"
jpd install --cwd ./frontend/
jpd install --cwd ./backend/
jpd run --cwd ./frontend/ build
jpd run --cwd ./backend/ test
```

### Debug-Driven Development

```bash
# Add --debug to any command to understand what's happening
jpd install --debug
jpd run --debug build
jpd exec --debug create-react-app my-app
```
