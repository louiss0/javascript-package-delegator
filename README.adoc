## Usage

[NOTE]
.This is a TDD project which means you test commands by running a test suite.
====


To test commands, you can run the following command:

```sh
ginkgo run
```

To watch files for changes and re-run tests:

```sh
ginkgo watch
```
====

### Writing Commands

When you create a new command, you should follow these steps:

. Create a new file in the `cmd` directory with the name of the command.
. In the file, make a called New{CommandName}Cmd function that returns the command you see after using `cobra-cli add`.
. In the `init()` 's `rootCmd.AddCommand()` Use the function you created in step 2.
. In the function write the flags and arguments for the command after the variable creation.
. Write tests for the command in the `javascript-package-delegator_suite_test.go` file.

TIP: Use the `cobra-cli add` command to create a new command.

NOTE: Remember to always add arguments to your commands.

CAUTION: Gingko will run tests in parallel by default.

This project has the cmd package and two other packages.
The `custom_errors` and `custom_flags` package.
The custom errors package was created to created named errors.
The custom flags package is created for generic flags.

The custom_flags is filled with flags that are meant to be used in cobra's `cmd.Flags().Var()` methods.
To use them you must create each struct in a variable then use each variable as a reference to each function.
I decided to use the word `root.go` as the name of each file because it makes it clear that it's the main file.
