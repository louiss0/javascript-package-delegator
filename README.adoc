// Abstract/Introduction
`javascript-package-delegator` (jpd) is a powerful and intuitive Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline your workflow across various JavaScript package managers. Inspired by the simplicity of `@antfu/ni`, `jpd` automatically detects the package manager used in your project (npm, Yarn, pnpm, Bun, or Deno) based on existing lock files and configuration, then transparently delegates your commands to the appropriate tool.

This eliminates the need to remember different commands or continuously switch between package managers when collaborating in diverse teams or managing multiple projects. `jpd` provides a unified experience, allowing you to focus on development rather than toolchain nuances.

== Features

`jpd` offers a comprehensive set of features to simplify your JavaScript development experience:

*   **Automatic Package Manager Detection:** Intelligently identifies the active package manager by checking for `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb`, `deno.json`, `deno.jsonc`, or `deno.lock`.
*   **Unified Command Set:** Provides a consistent API for common package management tasks, regardless of the underlying tool:
    ** `jpd install` (`i`, `add`):** Installs project dependencies.
    ** `jpd run` (`r`):** Executes scripts defined in `package.json` or tasks in `deno.json`.
    ** `jpd exec` (`x`):** Executes packages (e.g., `npx`, `yarn dlx`, `pnpm dlx`, `bunx`).
    ** `jpd update` (`u`, `up`, `upgrade`):** Updates installed packages to their latest compatible versions.
    ** `jpd uninstall` (`un`, `remove`, `rm`):** Removes specified packages from your project.
    ** `jpd clean-install` (`ci`):** Performs a clean installation with a frozen lockfile, ideal for CI/CD environments and production builds.
    ** `jpd agent` (`a`):** Displays the detected package manager for the current project.
*   **Intelligent Yarn Version Handling:** Differentiates between Yarn v1 and Yarn v2+ for `clean-install` and `exec` commands, applying the correct flags (`--frozen-lockfile` vs. `--immutable` / `yarn` vs. `yarn dlx`).
*   **Interactive Package Installation (`-s`, `--search`):** Provides an interactive interface for users to search for packages on the npm registry and select which ones to install.
*   **Interactive Script/Task Selection:** When `jpd run` is executed without arguments, `jpd` displays an interactive list of available scripts from `package.json` (or tasks from `deno.json`) for you to choose from.
*   **Interactive Uninstall:** Use `jpd uninstall` without arguments or with the `-i` flag to interactively select and remove dependencies from your project.
*   **Automatic Package Manager Installation Prompt:** If `jpd` detects a lock file for a specific package manager (e.g., `yarn.lock`) but that package manager is not installed on your system, `jpd` will now interactively prompt you to provide a command to install it globally, ensuring you can quickly get started without manual setup.
*   **Flexible Agent Selection:** Override automatic detection using the `--agent` (`-a`) flag or the `JPD_AGENT` environment variable to explicitly specify your preferred package manager for a command or session.
*   **Change Directory Execution:** Use the `--cwd` (`-C`) flag to execute any `jpd` command within a specified directory without changing your current shell's working directory. This is particularly useful for running commands in sub-projects or remote locations without manually navigating. Note: paths provided to `--cwd` must end with a trailing `/` (e.g., `/path/to/project/`) unless the path is the root `/`.
*   **Comprehensive Shell Completion:** `jpd` provides scripts to enable tab-completion for its commands and flags in popular shells, including Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, and Nushell.
*   **Volta Integration:** Automatically uses Volta to run Node.js package manager commands if Volta is detected on your system, ensuring the correct Node.js version (as defined by Volta) is used.
*   **Debugging Capabilities:** Enable a debug mode (`--debug` or `-d`) to view verbose logging, aiding in troubleshooting and understanding command execution.
*   **Go-based Performance:** Written in Go, `jpd` is compiled into a single static binary, offering fast execution and easy distribution without runtime dependencies.

*   `cmd/assets` is a new directory storing assets embedded directly with their Go code.
*   `custom_errors` is designed for creating named, reusable error types.
*   `custom_flags` provides generic flag definitions for Cobra commands, now including robust path validation.
*   The `detect` package encapsulates the logic for identifying the JavaScript package manager in a project, now with improved testability via injected file system and path lookup interfaces.
*   The `env` package contains environment-related utilities, potentially including checks for production/development modes.

We welcome contributions to `javascript-package-delegator`! If you're interested in contributing, please read our `CONTRIBUTING.md` (to be created) for guidelines on how to submit issues, features, and pull requests.

=== Writing Commands

When creating a new command for `jpd`, please follow these steps:

1.  **Create a New File:** In the `cmd` directory, create a new Go file named after your command (e.g., `mycommand.go`).
2.  **Define `New{CommandName}Cmd` Function:** Inside the new file, create a public function `New{CommandName}Cmd()` that returns a `*cobra.Command` instance. This function should contain the command's `Use`, `Short`, `Long` descriptions, `Aliases` (if any), `Args` validation, and the `RunE` or `PersistentPreRunE` logic.
3.  **Register Command in `root.go`:** In the `init()` function of `javascript-package-delegator/cmd/root.go`, add your new command to the `rootCmd` using `cmd.AddCommand(New{CommandName}Cmd())`.
4.  **Implement Flags and Arguments:** Define any command-specific flags or arguments within your `New{CommandName}Cmd` function. Ensure proper type and default value handling.
5.  **Write Tests:** Create corresponding tests for your new command in the `javascript-package-delegator_suite_test.go` file (or a dedicated test file if the command is complex), leveraging `ginkgo` and `testify/assert`.

TIP: Use `cobra-cli add <command-name>` as a starting point to generate the basic command structure.

NOTE: Remember to always add appropriate arguments and flags to your commands and handle them robustly.

CAUTION: Ginkgo runs tests in parallel by default. Be mindful of shared state in tests.
